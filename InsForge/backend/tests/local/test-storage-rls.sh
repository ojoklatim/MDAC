# E2E: Storage access is enforced by Postgres RLS, not by app-side filtering.
#
# Migration 036 ships RLS enabled with zero default policies (matching
# Supabase). This script installs an owner-only starter set via psql so
# section 1 has something to verify against — it's also the recipe a
# project would use to re-enable the pre-RLS owner-only behavior.
#
# Sections:
#   1. Owner-only RLS — Alice/Bob can't see each other's files via list,
#      get, or delete. Admin sees everything.
#   2. RLS override — drop owner SELECT policy, install a permissive one
#      ("public read inside this bucket"), verify both users now see
#      everything WITHOUT the storage service changing.
#   3. Path-based RLS — use storage.foldername(key)[1] = sub, verify
#      only files inside `<user_id>/...` are visible.
#   4. Third-party-auth-shaped JWT (text sub) flows the same path as
#      native UUID JWTs. This is what makes Better Auth / Clerk / Auth0 /
#      WorkOS / Stytch / Kinde work.
#      (Skipped if JWT_SECRET is not retrievable.)
#
# psql is required to install/teardown policies. CI installs
# postgresql-client into the backend container before running.
