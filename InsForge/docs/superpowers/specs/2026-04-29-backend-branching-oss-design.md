# Backend Branching (OSS) — Design

**Date:** 2026-04-29
**Status:** Draft
**Source PRD:** [insforge-cloud-backend Backend-Branching.md](../../../../insforge-cloud-backend/Backend-Branching.md)
**Cloud-backend spec:** [2026-04-29-backend-branching-cloud-design.md](../../../../insforge-cloud-backend/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-29-backend-branching-cloud-design.md)

This spec covers the **OSS slice** of backend branching v1: read-only fallback from a branch project's storage to its parent project's S3 directory.

## Problem

When a branch project is created from a parent, copying every storage object would be slow and wasteful (parent may have GB of files). The cloud-backend spec dictates: branch's S3 directory starts empty; reads of parent objects must transparently succeed via fallback. Branch writes go to branch's directory only; parent files are never modified from a branch.

## Goals (v1)

1. The OSS storage server, when started in "branch mode" (with an injected `PARENT_APP_KEY` env var), reads object data from parent's S3 path when the branch's path returns nothing.
2. Fallback is **read-only**. Writes (PUT/DELETE/multipart-upload) always target the branch's own appkey path.
3. Existing RLS / bucket-visibility checks continue to apply unchanged.
4. No HTTP API additions. Behavior change is server-internal.
5. Local-storage provider does **not** support fallback (cloud-only). Local installs are not branched.

## Non-Goals (v1)

- Cross-project fallback for non-branch projects.
- Write-through: copying a parent object into branch when first written to (CoW). Branches always start with the empty file set in their own namespace; modifications create new objects.
- Deletion markers: branch cannot "hide" a parent file. Deleting from a branch only deletes the branch's own copy (which doesn't exist for inherited files), so the parent file remains visible. Documented as v1 limitation.
- Schema-only mode files: when the branch was created with `mode='schema-only'`, the cloud-backend truncates `storage.objects`, so RLS/metadata returns 404 for parent files. This matches "fresh start" semantics — fallback is only effective for `mode='full'` branches.

## Current State Summary

- OSS storage server: TypeScript / Express monorepo at `backend/`. See [backend/src/server.ts:1-80](../../../backend/src/server.ts).
- S3 path layout: `{appKey}/{bucketName}/{key}` in a single shared bucket (`AWS_S3_BUCKET`). Code in [backend/src/providers/storage/s3.provider.ts:91-93](../../../backend/src/providers/storage/s3.provider.ts).
- `appKey` loaded from `APP_KEY` env var at server startup. Singleton pattern in [backend/src/services/storage/storage.service.ts:29-45](../../../backend/src/services/storage/storage.service.ts).
- HTTP read endpoint: `GET /api/storage/buckets/:bucketName/objects/*` ([backend/src/api/routes/storage/index.routes.ts:398-459](../../../backend/src/api/routes/storage/index.routes.ts)).
- `StorageService.getObject` returns `null` if metadata absent or S3 returns nothing — these are the natural interception points for fallback ([backend/src/services/storage/storage.service.ts:201-238](../../../backend/src/services/storage/storage.service.ts)).
- Presigned URL flow: `getDownloadStrategy` calls `getSignedUrl` from `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` (S3 sigV4 GET against `{appKey}/{bucket}/{key}`).

## Design

### Configuration

New env var:
- `PARENT_APP_KEY` (optional). When set, the server runs in "branch mode" and falls back to this appkey for object reads.

The cloud-backend injects this at branch container startup (alongside the existing `APP_KEY`).

### S3 Provider Changes

Extend `S3StorageProvider` to optionally hold a `parentAppKey`:

```typescript
constructor(
  private s3Bucket: string,
  private appKey: string,
  private region: string = 'us-east-2',
  private parentAppKey?: string,
) { ... }

private getS3Key(bucket: string, key: string): string {
  return `${this.appKey}/${bucket}/${key}`;
}
private getParentS3Key(bucket: string, key: string): string | null {
  return this.parentAppKey ? `${this.parentAppKey}/${bucket}/${key}` : null;
}
```

Read methods (`getObject`, `headObject`, `getObjectStream`, `getDownloadStrategy`) get a single new helper:

```typescript
private async withFallback<T>(primary: () => Promise<T | null>, parent: () => Promise<T | null>): Promise<T | null> {
  const a = await primary();
  if (a !== null) return a;
  if (!this.parentAppKey) return null;
  return parent();
}
```

Each read becomes:
- Attempt with `getS3Key(bucket, key)`. On null/404 → if `parentAppKey` set, attempt with `getParentS3Key(bucket, key)`.

Write methods (`putObject`, `deleteObject`, `createMultipartUpload`, etc.) do **not** call the fallback — they always target `getS3Key`.

### Presigned URLs

`getDownloadStrategy(bucket, key)` is the only read path that doesn't actually fetch the object — it just constructs a signed URL. For fallback to work for presigned URLs, we must do a HEAD against the branch path first; if 404, sign against the parent path. This adds a HEAD round-trip but is required for correctness. Non-404 HEAD failures (network, IAM, throttling) are caught and logged: URL generation falls back to the branch key rather than aborting the whole call. If the object truly only lives on the parent path, the signed URL will 404 at download time — degraded but recoverable, and a strict improvement over failing the entire request.

### Service Layer

`StorageService.getObject` and `objectIsVisible` rely on a metadata row in `storage.objects`. For `mode='full'` branches, that row exists (copied via pg_dump). The provider does the actual S3 fallback; service layer needs no change.

For `mode='schema-only'` branches, `storage.objects` is truncated by the cloud-backend after restore. Result: branch users get 404 from RLS lookup, never reaching the provider. This is the expected behavior — the storage feature simply doesn't apply.

### Failure Modes

- `parentAppKey` set but parent's directory was deleted (branch outlived parent — shouldn't happen given lifecycle cascade): primary 404 + parent 404 → final 404. Same as today.
- Parent exists but specific key missing on parent too: same 404. No new error path.
- IAM error reading parent path (cross-prefix permission denied): non-404 errors are propagated by the read helpers (`tryHeadObject`, `tryGetObjectStream`, `tryGetObject`); only true 404s are treated as not-found and trigger parent fallback. The public `getObject` wraps `withFallback` and surfaces any error as `null` to preserve the prior service-layer contract, but parent fallback is no longer triggered by transient/IAM failures. The IAM role for the EC2 already has access to the entire `insforge-storage` bucket per the existing single-bucket model; no permissions change required.

### Compatibility

- Local storage provider: ignored. `LocalStorageProvider` never receives `parentAppKey`. The constructor signature can be extended for symmetry but the fallback path no-ops.
- Existing non-branch projects: `PARENT_APP_KEY` is unset → fallback path never executes → zero behavior change.

## API

No new HTTP endpoints. Existing endpoints' behavior changes only for branches with `PARENT_APP_KEY` set, and only for read paths.

## Acceptance

A branch container started with `APP_KEY=branchkey` and `PARENT_APP_KEY=parentkey`:
1. `GET /api/storage/buckets/foo/objects/path/to/file.jpg` returns the file from `parentkey/foo/path/to/file.jpg` if `branchkey/foo/path/to/file.jpg` doesn't exist (assuming branch DB has the metadata row).
2. `PUT /api/storage/buckets/foo/objects/path/to/file.jpg` writes to `branchkey/foo/path/to/file.jpg` only.
3. After (2), step (1) returns the new branch-local file (branch path takes priority).
4. `DELETE /api/storage/buckets/foo/objects/path/to/file.jpg` (after 2) removes the branch's copy. Subsequent GET falls back to parent file again.
5. RLS still gates: a user without read access to the bucket gets 404, regardless of fallback.

## Open Questions / TBD

1. **Deletion markers (post-v1).** A branch may want to "hide" a parent file. Requires a sentinel object or a row in branch's metadata. Not in v1.
2. **CoW write-through.** When a branch writes to `path/to/file.jpg` after reading the parent's version, should we copy on first write? Today writing creates a fresh file at the branch path; reads naturally see the new file. No copy needed unless we want diff/merge of file contents (not in product scope).
3. **Schema-only branch + storage**. Confirm with cloud-backend team: should schema-only mode skip truncating `storage.objects`, so storage fallback works in that mode too? Current spec assumes truncate (matching "fresh start"). Worth a one-line check.
